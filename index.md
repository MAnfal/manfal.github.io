  <p>This site houses my journey through space and time while I am trying to find myself and grow.</p>
  <p>I have made a pact with myself to write a blog whenever I can so I will definitely do that but since trying to find oneself is a tedious task, please do consider this before contacting me. I might not be able to reply back.</p>
  <p>Please feel free to follow me on twitter. I hope you enjoy your stay here and thank you for your time. :)</p>
